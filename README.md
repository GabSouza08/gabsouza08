# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gabriel!

Iâ€™m a first-year Computer Engineering student at UFPB with a passion for all things hardware and tech. As a hobbyist computer technician, I love disassembling, fixing, and bringing new life to computers and consolesâ€”my latest project was reviving not just my own, but also my cousinâ€™s classic PS2!

While Iâ€™m just starting my academic journey, Iâ€™m driven by the idea of helping people and restoring projects that might otherwise be forgotten. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, tinker, and contribute wherever I can.

## ðŸš€ Interests
- Computer hardware & repair
- Reviving and preserving old tech
- Racing games & racing in general
- Exploring how computers work under the hood

Feel free to connect or reach out if you share any of these interests or have cool projects in mind!
